2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/num_capture_4bit_0/inst/FSM_sequential_rFSM_Next_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/num_capture_4bit_0/inst/FSM_sequential_rFSM_Next_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/num_capture_4bit_0/inst/FSM_sequential_rFSM_Next_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/num_capture_4bit_0/inst/FSM_sequential_rFSM_Next_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/num_capture_4bit_0/inst/FSM_sequential_rFSM_Next_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/num_capture_4bit_0/inst/FSM_sequential_rFSM_Next_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#1 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between design_1_i/num_capture_4bit_0/oData[8]_INST_0_i_1/I5 and design_1_i/num_capture_4bit_0/oData[8]_INST_0_i_1/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>
